# Glue the Giant Rack Modules

Although rack modules that mimic real-world mixing consoles are often used to
mix VCV Rack patches to a stereo output, they don't take advantage of the power
or flexibility inherent in a modular environment. The Glue the Giant modular
bus mixers use a polyphonic cable to route sound along three stereo buses. The
bus design makes it easy to efficiently patch together modules while creating
simple or complex effect sends and returns.
